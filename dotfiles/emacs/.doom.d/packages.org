** About this file
This is an Emacs literate package file. It contains the basic structure along
with some data about each package and why it's needed. This is to be used in
tandem with the ~define-package!~ function in ~config.org~.

Since it's primarily aimed at ~doom-emacs~ let's add their comments.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; -*- no-byte-compile: t; -*-
;;; ~/.doom.d/packages.el
#+END_SRC

** Magit Additions
These basically allow for TODOs in magit along with enhanced github integration.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! magit-org-todos)
(package! magithub)
#+END_SRC
