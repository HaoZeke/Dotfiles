** About
This is a literate config file for [[doom-emacs][https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs]] by
`hlinssner`. This
is meant to be used with the `develop` branch.
Much of the basic setup is pulled from the [[emacs literate
starter][https://github.com/gilbertw1/emacs-literate-starter]] by `gilbertw1`.

** Personal Information
Let's set some variables with basic user information.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "Rohit Goswami (HaoZeke)"
      user-mail-address "rohit.goswami@aol.com")
#+END_SRC
** Doom Emacs Stuff
*** Visual Tweaks
Honestly the basic font setting is simply not pretty enough.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Attribute Mono"
                           :size 20))
#+END_SRC
*** Spacemacs Equivalency
I find the default `jk` evil escape key sequence to be distracting as I am
unable to navigate with one hand on the mouse anymore.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default evil-escape-key-sequence "fd")
#+END_SRC

Also it's inconvinient to have a key chord requiring two hands to close a
buffer.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(map!
 (:leader
   (:prefix "b"
     :desc "Kill buffer" :n "d" #'kill-this-buffer)))
#+END_SRC
