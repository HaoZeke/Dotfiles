* About
For historical purposes, the older versions of my Dotfiles are
retained as branches. However, the ~chezmoi~ approach is current.

A key understanding of the workflow here is that Dotfiles should be
per machine, and not generically per configuration.

** Usage
Note that the ~chezmoi init~ command needs to be run twice, to grab some sensitive information which needs the encryption settings, as [[https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/pull/1521#issuecomment-940840570][discussed here]].
