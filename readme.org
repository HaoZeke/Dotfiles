* About
For historical purposes, the older versions of my Dotfiles are
retained as branches. However, the ~chezmoi~ approach is current.

A key understanding of the workflow here is that Dotfiles should be
per machine, and not generically per configuration.

By leveraging template substitution, conditionals can be eliminated from the
actual shell scripts, which allows for a faster shell. This does come at the
cost of portability, without the backing ~chezmoi~ machinery, the scripts are no
longer very portable.

** Usage
To get started, we need:
#+begin_src bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS chezmoi.io/get)" -- init --apply HaoZeke --branch chezmoi
chezmoi init
#+end_src
Note that the ~chezmoi init~ command is being run twice, to grab some sensitive
information which needs the encryption settings, as [[https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/pull/1521#issuecomment-940840570][discussed here]].
